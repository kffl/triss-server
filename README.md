# TrissServer
The following repository contains the backend service of Triss (Trip Support System) written in Java.

The project aims to streamline and automate the process of handling foreign trips of PUT workers.

The project is split into two separate repositories:

- [client app](https://github.com/kffl/triss-client), which is written in Angular
- backend service, stored in this repository

## Project management tools

This project uses ZenHub for project management. Each product backlog item is split into two issues between the frontend and backend repository (if applicable). Custom issue templates are used for representing a single product backlog item. Milestones are used for representing sprints.
